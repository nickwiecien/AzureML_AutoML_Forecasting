# AzureML AutoML Forecasting Pipeline Sample

![Background](img/01.png?raw=true "Background")

## Overview

This repo contains sample notebooks for constructing and Azure Machine Learning pipeline to:

- Retrieve data from an AML-linked blob datastore
- Format and organize retrieved data into train/forecast time-series 
- Run a AutoML forecasting training job using the extracted training time-series
- Register the best performing model derived from AutoML
- Generate a forward-looking forecast using the trained model 

The notebooks here will create a published pipeline endpoint in your Azure ML workspace that can be used for future model training/forecasting activities. Additionally, this pipeline is parameterized so you can optionally point at different data sources to train models over different sets of input data. 

As part of a quickstart we have included a separate environment setup notebook `01_Setup_AML_Env.ipynb` which creates a standalone datastore in the AML workspace and uploads a sample dataset containing information on sales of orange juice. The data used here was taken from the [OJ Sales Simulated Dataset](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/open-datasets/dataset-oj-sales-simulated?tabs=azureml-opendatasets) made available as part of [Azure's Open Datasets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/open-datasets/overview-what-are-open-datasets).

## Prerequisites

To run the code included in this repo you must have access to an [Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/) workspace. Details on provisioning an AML workspace can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/quickstart-create-resources).

We recommend running the notebooks contained in this repo from an Azure ML Compute instance. You can provision a new Compute Instance by following the guide below - we recommend selecting a `Standard_DS3_v2` SKU VM for this task.

Once your compute instance is provisioned, launch the terminal and execute the following commands:

```
cd Users/<YOUR-USERNAME>
git clone https://github.com/nickwiecien/AzureML_AutoML_Forecasting
```

This will surface all code from this repo inside your compute instance environment. Open both the `01_Setup_AML_Env.ipynb` and `02_Create_Model_Training_Pipeline.ipynb` notebooks and execute in sequence.
